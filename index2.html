                <h1>User Research</h1>
                <p>
                    My interest in research methods started in college. Studying psychology in college and working 
                    side by side with professors on their behavioral research studies gave me a great foundation in 
                    research principles. Georgia Tech’s UX/UI Bootcamp provided me with an excellent education in
                    User Research and an opportunity to work on several projects requiring numerous levels of testing.

                <h1>User Interface</h1>
                <p>
                    I have a passion for visualizing information in a way that is highly functional and brings 
                    joy to the user. There’s nothing more exciting than a blank slate to bringing your ideas to 
                    life. Although it’s easy to get carried away, it’s important to keep the user in mind and create
                     simple ways to visually express ideas. I strive to empower users by giving them the tools to 
                     complete tasks more efficiently.

                    I enjoy creating innovative solutions that inspire and foster memorable relationships between brands 
                    and those interfacing with their online platforms. Focused on writing clean, elegant, and efficient 
                    code that creates memorable experiences. I have a passion for fostering brand loyalty through intuitive 
                    design.
